A `useWallets()` hook you can use to obtain an array of `UiWallet` objects that represent the currently registered Wallet Standard wallets. You can render these wallets in the UI of your application using the `name` and `icon` properties within, you can enumerate the `UiWalletAccount` objects authorized for the current domain through the `accounts` property, and you can use the `UiWallet` itself with compatible hooks, to materialize wallet features and more.
